# Hi there, I'm pmatheus ðŸ‘‹

I'm a cybersecurity professional by day, dedicated to threat hunting and keeping digital environments secure. By night, I switch gears into the world of quantitative trading, a passion I hope to one day turn into a full-time career on Wall Street.

My coding journey started back in 2008 during my network engineering course, and I've been building and learning ever since!
